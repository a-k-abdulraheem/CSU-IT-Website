            <li>Our library uses the "Donation" channel in addition to "Purchasing" among the collection development methods. Materials donated to our library are evaluated and accepted within the scope of the collection development policy.</li>
            <li>IAU Information Center accepts library materials (books, periodicals, audio-visual materials, etc.) from individuals and legal entities that comply with the purpose and principles of the university library in order to support education and training at the university, contribute to research, and develop the library collection in line with the cultural needs of the users.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>The IAU Library takes the following into consideration when accepting any printed or electronic material as a donation.</h4>
        <ol type="a"  class="initial-padding">
            <li>Upon the application made to the Information Center by those wishing to make a donation, a committee consisting of two or three librarians and structured under the Acquisitions Department is assigned by the Department to examine and examine the donation in order to examine the collection to be donated and to carry out the necessary technical procedures.</li>
            <li>Information resources to be donated are delivered to the Library with a “Donation Delivery Report”. The Department Head has the authority to decide whether donated information resources will be added to the library collection, or whether those not added will be donated to other institutions or sent for recycling. Materials such as books that are not accepted because they are not up-to-date in terms of content, do not have historical value or are not suitable for the purpose of the university library can be evaluated in another type of library. Donors may be guided by the committee on this matter.</li>
            <li>Donations are accepted to the Library only after the committee examines the collection and finds it appropriate. If the resources are suitable for the library collection, technical procedures are carried out and accession numbers are given, and they are added to the collection like other materials and made available for the use of users. The priority for the necessary procedures to make donated books etc. ready for service is in line with the library's supply policy. In accordance with the supply policy, the priority is given to books etc. purchased with the requests of users such as teaching staff, students etc. in the procedures.</li>
            <li>The library may also apply to private or legal entities for collection donations. </li>
            <li> The materials to be accepted as donations must be up-to-date and scientifically sound, suitable for the education provided at the university, or supportive of researchers in social and cultural terms.</li>
            <li> Materials that are for ideological and religious propaganda purposes, that are incompatible with moral rules, that contain propaganda for terrorist organisations, or that are found to be insulting to national and religious feelings will not be accepted.</li>
            <li>Multi-volume works such as encyclopedias must be integrated. Materials that do not have an integrated volume (books, periodicals, encyclopedias) are not included in the collection. In order for periodicals to be accepted as donations, the beginning or continuation of the collection must be in the library.</li>
            <li>Materials such as books, periodicals, etc. that are worn out to the point of being unusable, have torn bindings, torn pages, or missing pages will not be accepted as donations.</li>
            <li>Manuscripts and rare works accepted as donations are kept in their own section. </li>
            <li>Donors of between 1500-3000 books are registered as silver donors, donors of between 3000-5000 books are registered as gold donors, and donors of 5000 and above books are registered as platinum donors on the Donation Board. A separate section is created for donors of 7,500 books and above.</li>
            <li>If the donated publication is available in the library collection (except for reserve publications), it will not be accepted.</li>
            <li>Special space requests from donors or institutions will not be accepted in order not to disrupt the shelf integrity of the collection. Donated publications cannot be requested to be kept in a separate section from the collection or together on the same shelf.</li>
            <li>The Department Head has the right to return the materials it accepts as donations or to donate them to another library if it deems appropriate</li>

            <li>Resources such as books, magazines, etc. that belong to or are published by the institution are not accepted as donations.</li>
            <li>The donor may request a list of the donated materials after the technical processes of the books are completed.</li>
            <li>If donors wish, they can have a seal made with their name and surname indicating that they have made a donation to the University Library and submit it to the library. This seal is printed on the inside cover of the works donated by the library. The name of the donor and the date of donation are recorded in the automation program used.</li>

            <li>Our library uses the "Donation" channel in addition to "Purchasing" among the collection development methods. Materials donated to our library are evaluated and accepted within the scope of the collection development policy.</li>
            <li>IAU Information Center accepts library materials (books, periodicals, audio-visual materials, etc.) from individuals and legal entities that comply with the purpose and principles of the university library in order to support education and training at the university, contribute to research, and develop the library collection in line with the cultural needs of the users.</li>

            <li>Upon the application made to the Information Center by those wishing to make a donation, a committee consisting of two or three librarians and structured under the Acquisitions Department is assigned by the Department to examine and examine the donation in order to examine the collection to be donated and to carry out the necessary technical procedures.</li>
            <li>Information resources to be donated are delivered to the Library with a “Donation Delivery Report”. The Department Head has the authority to decide whether donated information resources will be added to the library collection, or whether those not added will be donated to other institutions or sent for recycling. Materials such as books that are not accepted because they are not up-to-date in terms of content, do not have historical value or are not suitable for the purpose of the university library can be evaluated in another type of library. Donors may be guided by the committee on this matter.</li>
            <li>Donations are accepted to the Library only after the committee examines the collection and finds it appropriate. If the resources are suitable for the library collection, technical procedures are carried out and accession numbers are given, and they are added to the collection like other materials and made available for the use of users. The priority for the necessary procedures to make donated books etc. ready for service is in line with the library's supply policy. In accordance with the supply policy, the priority is given to books etc. purchased with the requests of users such as teaching staff, students etc. in the procedures.</li>

In order for periodicals to be accepted as donations, the beginning or continuation of the collection must be in the library.</li>
            <li>Materials such as books, periodicals, etc. that are worn out to the point of being unusable, have torn bindings, torn pages, or missing pages will not be accepted as donations.</li>
            <li>Manuscripts and rare works accepted as donations are kept in their own section. </li>
